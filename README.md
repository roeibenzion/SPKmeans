A full implemenatation of the Normalized Spectral Clustering algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering). 
This was a large scale project for me involving the C Python API, Python data science libreries (NumPy and Pandas) and mainly C code.
This imlementation supports activation from both languages (C and Python) and designed to print the outcome of every stages of the algorithm 
(getting the "goal" as the stage to print).
